**`Python dev | Binary Explotation & RE (CTF Player) `**

🌳I am a Computer Science student at UBT-Dukagjini Prishtina with a strong enthusiasm towards offensive security, particularly in pwn/RE🛠️, and scripting while also having an interesting dedication as a hobby towards bug bounty hunting(bugcrowd)🍯 that should go without saying to CTF competitions retrieving flags.
